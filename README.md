# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
In this project, I am following the instructions in assignment.md file. I have chosen option 2, FFA Wildlife Strikes dataset.
I am coming up with various statistical questions related to the dataset and providing insights and answers by creating visualizations and dashboards in Tableau.
The overall goal is to have dashboards/visualizations that derive insight from various important fields in the dataset to answer possible questions . 


## Process

- Picked a dataset from option 2 in assignment.md
- Loaded the dataset into Tableau
- Explored fields in the dataset by creating visualizations
- Came up with some questions
- Made dashboards with the most meaningful graphs
- Created a story to present my work and saved the story as a pdf file in my repository
- Saved my project workbook file as a .twb file in my repository

## Results

I have chosen option 2 and the FAA Wildlife Strikes dataset which is about different incidents where animals and aircraft collide. 
My main question: How can we minimize the amount of collisions occuring between animals and aircraft? 
I have created several visualizations. My main visualizations are: A map showing the number of strikes that occured per state. I used colour to easily visualize the states with high numbers of strikes, the ones in between, and the ones with a really low number. 
This visualization is really useful because it gives a quick view on which states are having the most occurances. I also have a dashboard showing various different visualizations showing the airports with the most incidents, the time in which the incidents happen most, a line graph showing strikes for different 
categories of animals per year, and for each phase of flight, the number of strikes and the type of animal that most strikes happened to. This dashboard gives a lot of useful information to answer our main question. There is also options to sort these results 
by a range of years, and you can also choose to look at either the top 10, top 15, or top 20 airports. Next I have a line graph predicting the number of strikes over the next few years. I created another graph showing the number of strikes that actually caused damage
per state. There is also an option to change the states you want to see.
## Challenges 
My main challenge has been time. I would have loved to spend more time on this project.

## Future Goals
Create more visualizations, explore more fields, add more key story points.
